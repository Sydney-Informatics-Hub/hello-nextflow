# Outputs

Instead of printing 'Hello World!' to the standard output it can be saved to a file. In a "real-world" pipeline, this is like having a command that specifies an output file as part of its normal syntax.

Here you're going to update the `script` and the `output` definition blocks to save the 'Hello World!' as an output.

## Redirecting outputs

The script block will need to be updated to **redirect** the 'Hello World!' output to a file.

The `>` operator can be used for output redirection.

!!!question "Exercise"

    Redirect 'Hello World!' to a file named 'output.txt' in the `script` block and add a comment to annotate your change.

    ??? "Solution"

        ```groovy title="hello-world.nf" hl_lines="1 10"
        // Use echo to print 'Hello World!' and redirect to output.txt
        process SAYHELLO {
            debug true

            output:
            stdout

            script:
            """
            echo 'Hello World!' > output.txt
            """
        }
        ```

## Outputs blocks

Outputs in the output definition block typically require an **output qualifier** and a **output name**:

```groovy
<output qualifier> <output name>
```

The **output qualifier** defines the type of data to be received. This information is used by Nextflow to apply the semantic rules associated with each qualifier, and handle it properly.

Common output qualifiers include `val` and `path`:

- `val`: Emit the variable with the specified name
    - For example, `val 'Hello World!'`
- `path`: Emit a file produced by the process with the specified name
    - For example, `path 'output.txt'`

See the [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#outputs) for a full list of output qualifiers.

!!!warning

    If you set the wrong qualifier the pipeline will likely throw errors.

The **output name** is a name given to the output variable. If a specific file is being produced it can be named in single quotes:

```groovy title="hello-world.nf"
output:
path 'output.txt'
```

The output name and the file generated by the script must match (or be picked up by a glob pattern).

!!!question "Exercise"

    Add `path 'output.txt'` in the `SAYHELLO` output block.

    ???Solution

        ```groovy title="hello-world.nf" hl_lines="4-6"
        // Use echo to print 'Hello World!' and redirect to output.txt
        process SAYHELLO {
            debug true

            output:
            path 'output.txt'

            script:
            """
            echo 'Hello World!' > output.txt
            """
        }
        ```

!!! warning

    This example is brittle because the output filename is hardcoded in two separate places (the `script` and the `output` definition blocks). If you change one but not the other, the script will break.

## Publishing directory

Without a **publishing** strategy any files that are created by a process will only exist in the `work` directory.

Realistically, you may want to capture a set of outputs and save them in a specific directory.

The [`publishDir` directive](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#publishdir) can be used to specify where and how output files should be saved. For example:

```groovy
publishDir 'results'
```

By adding the above to a process, all output files would be saved in a new folder called `results` in the current working directory. The process directive is process specific.

!!!question "Exercise"

    Replace `debug true` with `publishDir 'results'` in the `SAYHELLO` process block. Execute the pipeline again. View your new `results` folder in the working directory.

    ???Solution

        ```groovy title="hello-world.nf" hl_lines="3"
        // Use echo to print 'Hello World!' and redirect to output.txt
        process SAYHELLO {
            publishDir 'results'

            output:
            path 'output.txt'

            script:
            """
            echo 'Hello World!' > output.txt
            """
        }
        ```
